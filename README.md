This script loops through stocks and returns unique ticker and year for multiple pages in a workbook. For each ticker and year the 
summary table displays the yearly change in price, the percent change, and the total stock volume.

There is further analysis on the summary table that displays the stock with the highest percent increase, highest percent decrease, 
and highest total stock volume.
